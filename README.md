# Airbnb-LinearReg-SVM-DT-RF-modelling-and-prediction-in-Python
Airbnb price prediction models in python with linear regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms, and MSE, RSME, learning curve evalution matrics.


This project aimed to build a model that taken different airbnb's attributes such as bedrooms, location, house type, and others, to predict an optimal price which isn't too expensive that it drives guests away to other properties, or too cheap that it is not profitable to the host.


1. Summary: This analysis includes details step and coding of how to build such a prediction model from beginning to end. 
	1.1 First, the data is examined to gain both an overview and an in-depth understanding of the dataset. 
	1.2 Then, the business problem is framed.
	1.3 followed by data cleaning and visualization.
	1.4 Next step is building and validating models. 
	1.5 The best model selection and final evaluation.

2. Tool : Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn)

3. Algorithms:Linear regression, Support vector machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest

4. Evaluation: Cross validation and prediciton with mse and rsme score, learning curve fitting.

5. Dataset: 
Airbnb data for Bristol. The data contains information about all the Airbnb properties in Bristol as of November 2018 (2,375 and 28 attributes).
